# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems. Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
There are seven phases of the software Development Life Cycle and these include, planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment and maintenance. 
Planning: involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route.
Requirements analysis: seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users
Design:  is all about building the framework. Design phase is the link between the software’s purpose and its execution. It’s an essential step in creating software that works efficiently and provides an excellent user experience.
Coding: Is a phase where developers start converting the software design into tangible code 
Testing: involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding
Deployment: Involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
Maintenance: Is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model
Sequetial approach: Well defined stages and formal hand-offs from one stage to the next.
Requirements first: All requirements for a phase are completed before moving to the next and linear process with a final release or project completion
Predictability: provides clear milestones and deadlines
preferred scenarios: strict regulations and stable requirements
Iterative and Flexible: Divides work into time-based sprints, repaid iteration, autonomy and flexibility
Self-organizing teams: product management teams adapt and allocate resources and prioritizes delivering value to users quickly.
Uncertainty tolerance: Breaks down larger projects into smaller pieces and embraces change and experimentation
Preferred scenarios: Fast-Past Environments and Exploratory projects
Agile

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. 
Provides an unambiguous description of the requirements, which helps to reduce misunderstandings and errors. Helps to identify potential conflicts and contradictions in the requirements, which can be resolved before the software development process begins
Software Design Principles

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
 Modularity refers to dividing a system into separate modules or components. Each module handles a specific functionality and operates independently. 
 By using modularity, you make your code more organized, reusable, and maintainable. It allows for parallel development and enhances collaboration among team members. If changes are needed, they can be made to individual modules without impacting the entire system.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing: This is performed by developers. It focuses on testing individual modules or componenets in isolation. 
Integration Testing: It is performed by Testing teams and focuses on testing groups of related modules together. It aims to find interfacing issues between modules and verify if individual units integrate correctly into a sub-system.
System Testing: It focuses on testing the complete integrated application as a whole. It purposely validates the entire system against requirements and check system behavior, performe and security.
Acceptance Testing: It is performed by End-users or client representatives. It purposely verifies if the system meets business requirements and ensures it's ready for production use
Testing helps identify defects and errors in the software
Testing also ensures that the sofware meets quality standards. 
It also reduces the risk of deploying faulty software
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done.
They enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
Version control systems maintain a detailed history of code modifications. 
They also allow reverting to previous versions if mistakes happen.
They enable developers create branches for new features or bug fixes.
Version control systems ensure consistent and reliable releases.
Examples of popular version control systems include;
Git: Its features include, Distributed, speed, branching and merging and flexibility.
Subversion: it has features like centralized, atomic commits, access control, versioned directories.
Mercurial: Distributed, easy learning curve, performance, extensions
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager is a professional responsible for leading a team of software developers and ensuring that software projects are completed successfully. His roles are;
Project planning where he estimates project characteristics, allocates tasks among team members and defines project goals.
Project monitoring and control, he continously monitors project progress, identifies and mitigates risks. He ensures software meets quality standards.
Leadership and communication, he manages team dynamics, bridges technical teams and clients.
Challenges faced in managing software projects include; Poorly defined requirements, schedule constraints, budget constraints, poor communication,changing project requirements and skills management
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
Different types of maintenance activities include; 
Corrective software maintenance which purposely addresses faults, errors, and bugs in the software.
Prevenatative Software Maintenance which proactively prevents future problems. 
Perfective software Maintenance, it enhances software performance and features. 
Adaptive software maintenance, adapt software ot changing enviroments.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
These include;
Algorithmic Bias
Personal data collection
Weak security protection
Negativ feature impact relationship
They can ensure that they adhere to ethical standards in their work by following the practices below.
Continous learning
User-centric design, priotize user needs and privacy
Transparency, be transparent about data collection, algorithms and decision making processes
Code reviewsa and collaboration
Whistleblowing and reporting
Balancing business goals and ethics
